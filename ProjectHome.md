The OpenSCIM project aims to provide an Open Source implementation of the SCIM (Simple Cloud Identity Management) protocols.  Reference Implementations for the Restful SCIM interfaces are currently underway for Java and .Net.  The Java and .Net reference implementations include sample SCIM Clients and Services.

The Restful SCIM Services are being implemented with a pluggable architecture providing developers an easy way to implement their own SCIM services without implementing the SCIM Protocol Wiring.

Stay tuned, getting started guides for Java will be available soon.
